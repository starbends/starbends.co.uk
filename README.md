# starbends.co.uk

first off i am aware the website throws a security error. it's completely safe, i just haven't updated the ssl yet.

I wrote this website as part of a university project. 
I am a music student, not a web developer.
Therefore the code is not neat, it is not finished, and I had no experience in p5.js prior to this. 

A lot of it is stuck together with spit and tape and to be honest, makes absolutely no sense at all. 
It was more just a "can I?" type project. 

However it looks on the inside, the outside really is quite beautiful when you put it all together. 
The whole concept is self designed.

The music is made by myself (and later got a full release on an album) [the worst of it is over... (and god it feels good)](https://open.spotify.com/track/1kYsvhXSdhGYKIordEXPbg?si=a2a23e0b045745cb) 
The Sound FX were also all recorded by myself, with glasses, water, marbles, rice, BBs, and a kalimba. 
The Poems are all ones I have written over the last 12 months or so, some dating back a year or two, maybe. 
overall.... despite what how it came about, i'm still proud of the project at heart. It was the vision that mattered most, I feel. 

# Improvements to code

If you have any experience in p5, and feel like touching this up, go ahead and give it a shot in a virtual live-environment through VSCode or your pad of choice. 
I have included all of the original source code, materials and sound for you to use, alongside the libraries. 

Mirror it to your computer and give it a shot. 
If you can improve the existing code flow any better I'd heavily appreciate it.
